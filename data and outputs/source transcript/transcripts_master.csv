This is alright. Of the show. I think that's why people here. I remember I feel like in our classic episode of super car toys that we we talked about if you know, there are things that we could do. There are there are hacks that we could deploy but we're not going to do that cuz that's not that's not part of the show at the show, you know, the show the show is not about half.

Well, you know, I haven't haven't getting a lately and I'm I'm going to stick with that. You know, I have a good friend that that the claims that she never get sick. And and when I have personally witnessed her being sick she denies that she's sick and that's such a such a flip from most people or I don't know from a lot of people who are always getting sick when they're not she never gets sick when she is and I've started to kind of adopt that mentality. I'm not sick. I don't get sick. I'm actually pretty interested in a COS. I have met people like this and I it's hard to tell whether it works or not. It's one of those things like, you know, scare the alligators away, but like I've met people who seem Nearest oh fixed in there insistence that they aren't sick and don't get sick. Yeah that they sometimes seem to actually beat it back and I wonder if that works. I wondered about what what I'm about the corollary the corollary is we're constantly think you're getting sick and that you do get sick. Now, I believe that can be a thing that happened used to have it on me all the time. You remember when I would come on this program might be sick all the time. You used to be sick all the time. I was sick all the time. And now I'm chasing the alligator away as what is what we're basically saying so so that's happening. I feel I feel some Sensations which are not sickness and patience but read just simply my body's telling me that I'm alive and that foreign agents are working or looking around the the the dark corners of the city of my lungs and nose and I'm not going to allow them. I'm going to bit basically going to be a counter in surgeon see On the part of my white blood cells another other things that I don't understand.

There's probably other stuff out there in the universe, right? There's some people who say will obviously there's nothing else out there in the universe or they already would be here. I don't have the logical skills to say whether that makes any sense. I think we could also probably agree that if there are people coming here people listen to me right people Sheriff.

0,Doc336,I really on any of them it was just sort of like this thing that transpired when we all got together I think we were all kind of in the same boat meaning that I felt like in my own life I had matured becoming a responsible adult you at the time of filming American reunions my wife was pregnant I've been married for you know nearly five
0,Doc337,me about Tyler Perry and his brand is that that's what he does so well he takes everyday life problems he magnifies them brings you know brings you to the core of it and then makes makes makes it light and funny and in a way that we can deal with it and I love that I love that about the movie I love that about the cast I think that a lot of women and not just single mothers I think that a lot of women and men are going to be able to I Really identify with a lot of the stories that are that are being that we are aiming to portray hear me specifically my character Esperanza is a woman let me back up I feel that as Latin women I think you will understand that we often times we it's part of our culture eye thing to just when we fall in love when we have a family that we
0,Doc338,and it was such a team team effort it would start to collaboration between one of us that it but it's so nice to be sure
0,Doc339,sad were you no camera positioning or something that rendered one of us unable to say the line was supposed to say and he's able to appropriate right now appropriate it right there and that made it a lot easier but we know he's great and super collaborative
0,Doc340,nominees not tonight but that night at the Hollywood roast

0,Doc342,because she was the unit the Beloved and I was the lover I was expecting her to kind of technician

0,Doc345,well you know what yes he's a big budget movies and then lot of action love sci-fi elements and all of that but at the same time there's a messaging within them that's really important and relevant to younger audiences and older audiences messages about our society and

0,Doc355,and they didn't delve so much into a mythology Corner that they had to keep
0,Doc356,but the idea was I mean I didn't know and this is how it works sometimes I didn't know how important Jesse was going to be in this against pictures of my life pointed you kind of feeling your way through it when you're right in the show Vera

0,Doc367,every once in every movie does it seem like that is very
0,Doc368,hung her Identity On News Benz with white dot underneath her and I think to an extent we do feel that when we come out of school and become out of his system where we've had some things we can even normally it's like what are you doing why do that and when you first come out of school and you're fine
0,Doc369,absolutely hope for them I truly think they're soul mates
0,Doc370,reasons I really like I couldn't be more lucky and I couldn't be more more happy that Sally evolved into the person that
0,Doc371,yeah it's hard to talk about it without spoiling without spoiling the story but I don't know

0,Doc378,Felicia constantly change your mind and say hey
0,Doc379,certain sort of end and the day begins and that seems like
0,Doc380,because it's a story if it's kind of weird sorry about
0,Doc381,his genius was taking the pain of growing up and relating it to everyone his gift was creating characters stories and truths about being a teen and bringing them to film in a way that no one has ever done before it is why
0,Doc382,I don't know hopefully it would be pretty cool I mean it's you not every day you get to see
0,Doc383,the city play on the senior account on sync on go down
0,Doc384,but we thought it was pretty funny and gold he's with it though this is so funny this movie going to be so great this is exactly what my psychics
0,Doc385,a sixteen-year-old aunjanue
0,Doc386,it had a main character who is a little selfish but he had a good heart somewhere deep within him
0,Doc387,let you know know I'm embarrassed that's why I never have parties no I don't want to be even on the movie set or so if you're working I'm sure you do it
0,Doc388,very Thai black tooth with all those bowls around us and Them sensors tools
0,Doc389,very intense that way but such respect for that Nancy's
0,Doc390,he's like my brother you know and I know him very well and and you know I love working with the same actors kind of like a relationship you may get to know someone
0,Doc391,instincts that sort of make her who she is and so the fact that
0,Doc392,it went on from the beginning of that records to promoting that record on a 6S about record is it always there when I listen to it you know I can't really divorce myself enough to listen to it released
0,Doc393,all the inner workings of Assassin's Creed 3 having access to them and the people
0,Doc394,I think Americans try to have to toughen up and realize we've come a long way in the last
0,Doc395,every Monday at 9 p.m. to episodes the whole series from beginning to end
0,Doc396,but I but I don't I've never done anything for the money I don't believe in
0,Doc397,and and and got the part that way but little did I know that
0,Doc398,you and always having to use your imagination to some blues green but they really built
0,Doc399,London ends with an assistive Tech revolution in Grayson is an American car
0,Doc400,and then it just got to be really joyful and it's fun because you know
0,Doc401,things about it and until you know people just like to draw 10
0,Doc402,live at five lots of those decisions to wrestle with
0,Doc403,people put in so much work at these movies off the ground so when it comes to fruition vegan gets made in Excel can recognize me
0,Doc404,60 pages in a day so it's truly like Live Theater you get 1/2 takes Max interesting interesting medium
0,Doc405,sit by the pool all day long and don't want to work it's been the busiest last two years in my life I've done free place to movies reality show in development I run a children's museum a motivational speaker
0,Doc406,the exposure and the pageantry of it that it was killing him same as just an aspect of that there are many other aspects
0,Doc407,she called me to come home right now I have some designs
0,Doc408,you know we would do these scenarios right was nine of us verse three Marines and it you know might as well been 30 of us cuz it didn't
0,Doc409,lover of architecture and so just the building itself is great but the thing that impressed me the most with how this Museum communicates two children in into two adults as well the art of anime
0,Doc410,turn the flashlight on red but he always asks you know what is your music what is your sound and it to be honest with you I try to add it all elements music ever
0,Doc411,human resource management
0,Doc412,world to me that gets up in the morning says today I'm going to be me
0,Doc413,just so you know you guys aren't in the show that way cuz sometimes we were and sometimes we weren't they said no look there's rich
0,Doc414,that business with the doorbell in the knocking and I said to James What if I
0,Doc415,it is a I would I prefer to be anonymous all the time yeah I would be because I like it and I also feel like it's good
0,Doc416,recycle because my town of Longmont was a Target City for the most teenage pregnancies in Colorado so we had to I don't know if it's sexy or boy or probably
0,Doc417,toy laser guns which I have to say is the most fun
0,Doc418,and I had the privilege of meeting so many people who were really deeply connected to this tragedy and it'll people who were not you know seeking us out they weren't seeking attention they didn't come knocking on our door we came knocking on their doors and because Mark is from boss is very well respected in that community that made it a little bit easier for for us to make those connections but the
0,Doc419,quite a lot of the last time I fell fast which we love very much
0,Doc420,I think of the big difference would be probably the Bible it's more of the documentary thing as an epic story of the whole Bible but this is a more
0,Doc421,just affect you forever and they become funny stories they become Tall Tales you know and the retelling and and that's what this movie is there's a Frank that's about it that anyone can identify with whether you're young
0,Doc422,XXII
0,Doc423,driving out of this very short time we were driving and it's me and Florence and and doing this.
0,Doc424,I don't mean to depression
0,Doc425,point is that the point was it was going to be a very mechanical again with the mechanical storytelling that's verboten but it was a mechanical way of
0,Doc426,to the the band wasn't in the sky about doing the music for that filmed
0,Doc427,he's an exceptional Talent see if you watch him you can't imagine that there's a certain amount of mature
0,Doc428,eventually I think I think whatever you guys are the ones who will decide
0,Doc429,open the old horror films you know where you need to be able to have a haskana feelings when they
0,Doc430,that was just an ambassador from Bolivia how much money has white baboon and it looked like a Yeti let me go to Marvel sweater cost
0,Doc431,they just asked me to partner with him on the campaign and I was really excited because I am a headache sufferer and I can just relate to anybody struggling with with headaches
0,Doc432,size of the screen really cuz you know we shot widescreen which is 4.4 or whatever means then you can have that the Black Box on the top and bottom and so what they did is they just decided they were going to extend the effects off of that so that it what can 3D it feels like it's really coming off the screen at you and is a such an effective
0,Doc433,in the entire history of of the of the film industry some of that works of absolutely fit
0,Doc434,that I have to maintain this this element
0,Doc435,all wrong with your none of that is moralistic she's using her body to realize that ambition and she knows it but at the same time to put rate in such a way that you feel sad for her you feel sad for desperation
0,Doc436,issues or or possibly some chips he hasn't dealt with I mean that they seem to be in a mounting upon Him throughout every episode in the second half of the Season he's got his family issues has the the the guilt of his dead father his sister
0,Doc437,can use promethazine is a tomato a fruit or no he's well
0,Doc438,really there's some really great storylines with honor and Bates always has a disgrace to a really interesting journey I think that's the beginning of the full series is very much about married
0,Doc439,you know I just mentioned over the weekend you know he had The Bravery
0,Doc440,because it's also special for this year at 4
0,Doc441,the island of Lost plug-in which is really a study of my experiment to what's happened to Martin de Manuel
0,Doc442,so that was brilliant and it made every Haven want to come in energy as well
0,Doc443,you know that we appear to as a people and I feel it in Mexico and I don't know I just feel like I'm with my people even though I'm really full
0,Doc444,play Raz got me in the call back of the last mission in the country
0,Doc445,then at that smile of hers in the hair and the fur cuz she's
0,Doc446,what kind of a full circle back to my early days in movies where I buy my parts were not big enough to have an actual name
0,Doc447,so you you there is a lot there that there is an element of that to this that I think is kind of cool just like another even in the car
0,Doc448,Nordstrom inspiration from Joseph Campbell books about mythology and creating the mythological underpinnings of the Star Wars
0,Doc449,countdown all along with a math that's so my math book they look more like teen magazines the math books and the reason is because I want girls to see I belong here to I
0,Doc450,play with one's work before the movie my dad's favorite film where one of them is Heaven Can Wait so I've been hearing about masturbate
0,Doc451,it's telling the story and sometimes what was on the page cannot be delivered in and it was the the collaborative aspect of a huge success the more people the better outlook for 10 remember the first day when I arrived in the makeup room to test and Ben said can I stay
0,Doc452,is someone has very strong ideology she's incredibly determined but at the same time she sees someone she's a human and she falls in love with someone who may not be the the
0,Doc453,they were doing it I actually thought like what else could we get
0,Doc454,yeah I mean I I kind of I didn't really intend to be an accident and I kind of got the
0,Doc455,into the environment so yeah it's never just even one process as usual mixture of like 5 or so
0,Doc456,yes all the characters that I've done it on the radio based on people I don't know precious when I get the idea is my actual people here it was kids we used to live in dumb-show On the Border
0,Doc457,the great characters in the Marvel Universe but it had this sort of weird little Edge to it that I really enjoyed and and I just thought well with Paul funny
0,Doc458,stay on as honest as I can always do phone because I think people that
0,Doc459,did definitely use I think the thing about this is that it's all about survival at any point anyone could find them full second to people not.
0,Doc460,pretty much at the age of five I always wanted to go on the stage sing something and so I was not afraid
0,Doc461,purpose they're all working together it's like being a circus are on the road you know when there's a whole bunch of people together they're just working for the same goal they're doing
0,Doc462,when I came back to the show got picked up after the pilot and I came back to do a j sandwich was not directing that first real Paul Bogle
0,Doc463,when I say it out loud sometimes people think I'm a bit crazy but I got all these teeth I've like
0,Doc464,the first Starbucks the England ever received because your volume was this area
0,Doc465,and I think that's why it's lent itself so well to cinema and there have been so many cinematic incarnations over the year and he's kind of version of the story speak to the time in film that it was made and so for me it was really exciting to put this kind of contemporary Hollywood stamp on the story that really speaks to where we are at storytelling today so it was really exciting I mean of course you feel a lot of responsibility but I think because ours is an origin story and it's really about pulling apart the myth and looking at The Man Behind the legend that was it wasn't like we were we tell
0,Doc466,AAA
0,Doc467,but it just kind of flew by is this that at all the scriptures in the film like what was like it sold at very very fast so
0,Doc468,or face what's left
0,Doc469,was it since I would write everything I would write these in mentally ill
0,Doc470,Willem is the right up mr. Jensen and myself to the story and it's not really based on true events
0,Doc471,I got in the water because of sharks which makes no sense and I try to explain him there's nothing to fear from sharks is not going to happen I mean understand why I start shark attacking Surfer every now and again and having them looks like a sea lion
0,Doc472,all the process while we recorded the entire album in Atwater Village
0,Doc473,hoping that by osmosis and some of her genetics are able to transfer onto me
0,Doc474,weird it is that I work at the the place that I always do
0,Doc475,interesting rib pain because Matthew and Mary would have been just you know if you having another child
0,Doc476,we start shooting and we had the financing and literally I think 3 days or something before we were going to start shooting we lost a fight
0,Doc477,you been able to be called I'm mad we were a boy you know I've been
0,Doc478,Aidan Turner who plays the Luke who's kind of the main werewolf
0,Doc479,I'm glad I never didn't have a BB gun in my hand so that's what I've been preparing for this my
0,Doc480,shows that something and just you know like an acting job here they're so to get back into play
0,Doc481,she's there so much knowledge out here and it to acquire and when you find
0,Doc482,Define zaffina okay but I think I have to be quite delicate about it
0,Doc483,I never would have had hair that good I did I mean when I was 10 I had lovely out of hair
0,Doc484,a big fan of that film and then kind of got to know the franchise's I go to be older so it's great to now be part of that and and and
0,Doc485,giving a critique of five shows and and we were the last one that they got
0,Doc486,a long long time a straight-A student but I started teaching dance however my
0,Doc487,and there was one scene in the in the penultimate film at the wedding where there was a reference to Tanya being a little bit while having initially been a bit jealous but then then realizing that he's actually picked but the rights lady not vampire and I'm not going to think it just became so divisive
0,Doc488,I can relate to that you want to hang out with every week that we're going to talk about culturally provocative things and try and give the audience a perspective on him and I grew up on
0,Doc489,you know what it was released for 3 days and Transformers just released for 3 days we've already got 100 million dollar spot
0,Doc490,as you like it. Sound like this when you would say
0,Doc491,no that's that's what's so good about Tyler movies because they have a message even though they make you laugh in a message in this MO
0,Doc492,I can really do small things and big things and
0,Doc493,favorite personal episode of my TV wife discovers a lump on self exam
0,Doc494,it depends on how it depends on what we're fighting about but I also feel like that's
0,Doc495,little jewels that you find as you go through the book over and over is I do occasionally you know that's the root of our tree that book and so every every little leaf and every flower that we managed to sort Aveeno create as we go along as I'll born from that place and so you know it's nice just wouldn't go back to to the Bible of the world that were
0,Doc496,and I'm and I worked on the golf course
0,Doc497,we owe anything lot at least she's actually it might your imagination started again cuz you're not working because I'm driving your imaginary
0,Doc498,and I've come to understand that you cannot when I open the theater I bought a abroad
0,Doc499,no I think it's you know Tommy is I've known him a little bit I've never worked with him I've been a huge fan of his work but it is it's no fluke that that that Hamilton is as good as it is I mean there's so many elements involved but I think now knowing him and thinking back to seeing it twice
0,Doc500,I know that by living the life that I choose to live which is a mindful life it is it you have to be
0,Doc501,I didn't give the kids candy close the door at the talking down everything's okay or you're safe mommy it was Daddy doorbell rings
0,Doc502,who is always in Jim I mean is this magical human being
0,Doc503,so this is my high school reunions seeing this whole
0,Doc504,well yeah but I mean Russia House for example I think is a very good movie and a good example of what I'm talking about I love this store
0,Doc505,Thunderbolt will really kind of rocking making money you know huge all over
0,Doc506,maybe at some point they would have to know Mary would have gone off and had a fling with someone or what would have happened
0,Doc507,I just I wish you would just see me as a human being and not like this glammed-up
0,Doc508,call me I've done where I really got to take the essence of my stand up and put it in with that and I think so for me this is one where I really feel like a zombie evolving into film
0,Doc509,it would depend I think in Jake's character situation I might have done the same thing what are you going to do you know you're out there you hit your vulnerable there's not
0,Doc510,it's it's a pyrrhic relationship that I have to that aspect of the character because there's so much for war
0,Doc511,you. Tell them that it's none of our sister guy.
0,Doc512,or scenes in this movie it's a wonderful role would he do it would it or would he come audition for it and and and and
0,Doc513,to make the studio make great movies again if that truly deeply entertain audiences to put the filmmakers the artist the animators the story people creatively in charge either of these films again
0,Doc514,The Weeknd
0,Doc515,story in the filaments is centered around the Love Story between her and lied and then also just that the story of love and family with her Vlad and Ingress and so I am
0,Doc516,so we understand where that's coming from so there's nothing to comment on that the numbers speak for themselves so please
0,Doc517,that was something additional you know and every the ABCs for example you know the intention here was that these Angel to live in the ceiling of the children's nursery can come down when Mom and Dad aren't
0,Doc518,I found it rather tedious and boring when she can't be on the phone satin played football in
0,Doc519,but I think that's out of area that's that's just in where most people actually lives and then you go down the back
0,Doc520,Breaking Bad so I was obviously very disappointed with how I am
0,Doc521,people make record song the time but it don't think they take
0,Doc522,play I cheated myself a few years back and took a lot of talking myself into but I wanted a really nice piano and I was talking to some of my writer friends and they're like oh my gosh. Go by piano and I like but the one I want
0,Doc523,so I just thought I'll just have forty winks and I'll read that when I'm when I'm more awake on the bottom line was I never got around to read
0,Doc524,lemonade days are my favorite days
0,Doc525,going to things that we've not seen before I am so excited to see
0,Doc526,a most people whose mothers made out of Tarth in the same ideals but every time I acted up it was like my mother was always right
0,Doc527,I mean I mean I had something I'm confident enough to reclaim cuz you can really really climb that you can have obscene power over people but yeah
0,Doc528,scenes with these guys in the car trying to figure out how to pull off things that they have no capacity to pull
0,Doc529,like I got is all hang out watching football game on Sunday bring some pizzas and wings some drink some soda
0,Doc530,put me to sleep at like maybe like before time I ate 9 when I was eight or nine and she would pull my hair all the way back just to see what I would look like she's like she would look at me
0,Doc531,David out there for about almost a year and then recently I went to Morocco which was amazing too and every High it is sunny we just wrapped the show on Friday so now I'm like where am I going
0,Doc532,and I've never met anyone like that before you know my brother's gays Bengay for will forever since he was born be been married to dude for 12
0,Doc533,is that the bike is for the story and his parents don't actually know it was him because we covered it up so well the story like I might know a lot of people with muscular dystrophy because I
0,Doc534,the NAT character I don't even remember where that character came from but he's kind of like this mystical weirdos on campus who who actually drop some knowledge like it actually got some wisdom
0,Doc535,Diamond Vogel grown ups now that probably should never got married that just went and Rod for each other not take there was lots of circumstances Mama obviously wasn't
0,Doc536,and it's the first time I've seen one of my characters outside of Pixar and I was so stunned my boy cat

0,Doc548,she starts and I think it started because she didn't have a ton of balance right and then now we've encouraged it and that's
0,Doc549,intense. Of time there was a side of me that was like you know just whatever your instincts are in life just go for it life is short you have nothing to lose and
0,Doc550,but I didn't know what the Jimmy Jimmy Durante and Sammy Fain and Sami Khan and Burt Bacharach and these guys that hung out at the track

0,Doc565,any easier about you know predators and an online chat

0,Doc620,call seems like a giant Loop airport Universal Studios Beverly Hills Hotel Airport
0,Doc621,who lends itself to really having a lot of heartwarming moments the characters and you you really do get to see a lot more relatability with all the characters because of that because that humor even though there is a lot of very dramatic moments on his action. They will a cracked occasionally and then you find a lot of humor and always funny
0,Doc622,and do tell a lie for the Discovery Channel so we kind of left that there and I'd love to do a show
0,Doc623,but I like to like someone that I'm with I I've never been one so much for just going out and seeing some

0,Doc627,somebody else doesn't go forward it fills the spot I have a better chance of not getting another singer I believe with those funny little people that I could create I believe I can create from something
0,Doc628,I think you know especially with people like David Blaine it's also a hybrid of magic and stunts and an endurance test and that's what we've kind of wanted to do with the Steve Gray
0,Doc629,and I woke up and I wanted to experience that so I
0,Doc630,I really can't fit down there and because it was a very emotional scene for me
0,Doc631,but really it to me bothered by Sun looks over talent the acting is always overdone it's never like you know you know
0,Doc632,well he's do you know he's a killer I've worked with him before I did a voice on Finding Nemo so it gave me a little introduction into how they work but those guys to fix our guys and gals
0,Doc633,friends and there was such Variety in people there will bookies and they were robots and robot that you fell in love with and and women with really strong personalities that wouldn't take no for an answer so don't make cool men and

0,Doc637,was he making a political statement or was that his emotional reaction wasn't for show or was it not
0,Doc638,longer you know I think some people can read description to two hours and in the time it would take to watch the filming of they can just put them it takes a whole days to breed 1 script and I really have to put time aside to to learning Lines by was thinking of a contact to spend in a daze and days carving some people chat or weeks I should perhaps spend days and days
0,Doc639,Timbre of his voice voice actor but no I think
0,Doc640,you know she told me she raised me with certain morals of certain standards but you don't like any kid when I was out there with my friends you know I I cut up I wild out
0,Doc641,energy focusing on how to break a company apart what to do with it so I had this moment where I was in complete creative control and I could do whatever I thought was right for Gucci so I designed a collection that was
0,Doc642,the Fairy Godmother she's often seen as a fairy godmother and so the stuff appoint the self is very good
0,Doc643,but I don't think too much shut the television surfing these days I better if I came across it and I didn't have much to do I'll probably watch it cuz I'm just
0,Doc644,I moved my design studio when I was a Gucci to London hey because I love London and I wanted to spend more time
0,Doc645,I can only do a lot better this time I would imagine I'm a lot different than I was two years ago
0,Doc646,also became strengthening and and exhilarating but it took a while I mean
0,Doc647,fart above worth it so there's nothing that I would change because every single thing has been
0,Doc648,sound the same way it's just kind of it just had the same the same scale in the same field and was kind of really kind of Transport you back to that time
0,Doc649,people people listen to consistently surprised at the fat bomb store
0,Doc650,before the 1982 election so that is that there's absolutely no chance that it will get out of this house
0,Doc651,States and Britain would help them or that also would be more successful inspectors that's what they do their very well trained to find weapons that's what they
0,Doc652,and Greg gets close to where in this movie she he becomes her friend but it's not what he hopes but I guess
0,Doc653,my intentions were all knotted up and dying and in a couple hours I would be dead along with them so he took me down they didn't the ambulance and they took me down the doctor examined me and he said here's what's happened you have an obstruction in urine test
0,Doc654,really I would say you know identify what your Wellness Orwell factors are really really passion about take money off the table first of all stop using money is an excuse I really want to do this but I can't afford I really wanted to take that away if it's money was not part of the equation what are you passionate about what makes your heart beat faster what do you love now we know that let's reverse-engineer a plan
0,Doc655,yeah he actually chose that he likes to dress up as Batman and I said you know I'll get a costume and I somehow there's an adult section in the costume shop in New York and he's like I like that one it was on a mannequin and it's literally like latex back girl's thigh high boots and I
0,Doc656,hard to get the the right the proper Finance money
0,Doc657,have people get a sense of who I was and it wasn't as bold a movie as it appeared from my standpoint
0,Doc658,what remake does you pay full price is it absolutely anything I just need a lowercase cursive B comes back Monday open up the cake box guy says is this what you wanted he says yes thank you all this is perfect I'm so glad we got it right the store says the guy at the store says
0,Doc659,kind of the summer before I got the big job that brought me to New York in my hometown and I I bartended most nights but I waited tables one night a week and it was just not for me I didn't
0,Doc660,all of the Monday morning in the sea I held her in my arms instead show me beginning
0,Doc661,I started going to a acting class and and studying a lot I really got into it I did a lot of fear. A lot of
0,Doc662,it is hard living and I think we're Omar spoils his TV viewer saying reality show is where we think they're somewhere remote on an island
0,Doc663,it was hard to to that's what I say to go to
0,Doc664,so I have your
0,Doc665,so I don't think she said dad I don't know if I'm coming back and I'm pretty sure that her dad isn't you know
0,Doc666,and that's not going to work out if either all the shit and I'm just working my way out of it my manager Alex and you guys will stay in touch so I thought that was the end of it
0,Doc667,Russian for end and I want to see your interpretation of it so that I think we all feel
0,Doc668,I'm to tell that story but I'm also when you stop watching you forget who you watch
0,Doc669,craning up or down is that the same
0,Doc670,couple scoops of a spoonful like not like actual just big chunks for like getting my Blake the cold and then the coffee taste it's very weird I've had a lot of a virgin but I think was crazy to me is that I don't realize I'm pregnant I'm still going on my daily
0,Doc671,found any particular Faith or it doesn't it doesn't hold one fact about the other it's just that you know coaches a difference allow them to be so what if I can get out I think we live in a world where we try to bully people into our
0,Doc672,as another writer-director her movies and characters are are so layered and the thing that that's so beautiful about them is she writes all
0,Doc673,Edward reports written about us and reported Nickerson Road came out of
0,Doc674,I was like that would look I mean you watch in the last series how was it developed and when we have the same as in the yard with that it's genuinely scary scary in any horror film you know forrados so yeah I thought it was great that we are actually go away with that but that was one of the reasons I guess you know they go with go with the stories cuz they looked genuinely frightened inside but yeah he tried to
0,Doc675,if I Albert Lea show others
0,Doc676,for one reason or another usually because their kids when they saw it stopped eating meat and they were Furious
0,Doc677,I had to go to Seattle to do eight shows in Northern Exposure and I beg them to hold my job broke cuz when I love this job and and to you know I thought I was going to go there for a chose and come back and
0,Doc678,a deep self-loathing that's well I mean she says the line off to that she says I won't make something that makes them on
0,Doc679,have to do into each other especially so there's not so much of that I think going on I just think every day we are kind of in awe
0,Doc680,but he is one of my oldest friends I went to NYU film school with him and he work with me as a writer in The X-Files and this is about two years after the X-Files ended and we were bemoaning our sad state of unemployment at that moment
0,Doc681,emails for the whole of the next week. I do hope you
0,Doc682,and his father told him constantly be a plumber people will always
0,Doc683,what is the difference of the experiences out there whether it's at Necessities or religions or if it's just
0,Doc684,life is not a series of Giggles the way most half-hour come
0,Doc685,ways of people who are who are walking you were trying to get away from their their own countries in and find existence and in other countries so that's what this drama is about it that's in the show what it's about it's about this this different group coming in that the majority population of very fearful of and they want to exclude them and they want to blame them
0,Doc686,wonderful ridings could be wonderful I just don't know you
0,Doc687,or like you're those guys and that's that guy we did we already know that
0,Doc688,no question from day one and and it was a point of great concern with him of of great concern that is two people that he cared about and I fell
0,Doc689,so I mean it was a big decision that John made to go on location over there it's not easy to shoes it was a lot of them very bad weather and I think I'm trying to remember I think it was
0,Doc690,and it did the other kind of sketch which was two people
0,Doc691,and I saw I mean I right away I felt like I saw it was less falling in love with Florence and more it feel like falling in love with Rogers Through Florence has eyes pretty
0,Doc692,you to explore it and acting is a momentum sport so you're trying to get momentum to get out of your own way and be as present as possible and end end tv allows you to do that be
0,Doc693,I mean we we really only seen him in one and one light other than you know that one episode so I think that would be
0,Doc694,a good feeling starts with the people and starts with understanding of what you're trying to do in the film it
0,Doc695,how much it cost is it more expensive here or not okay so there's a couple of seats
0,Doc696,how to do that went to New York and there's a Broadway show I did stand by to No Strings Richard Rodgers was going to let had me to do the the London company
0,Doc697,things keep on changing you are doing your best but things happen
0,Doc698,it makes you think a nice it if you walk out of the move and maybe a think about your your own
0,Doc699,it's going well I just I'm on camera and I have a quick question to ask
0,Doc700,I think it would be very intriguing but it's not about just steampunk it just happened
0,Doc701,replicate anything from one form of the media to the other things that work perfectly in comics
0,Doc702,I just want to say thank you for having me okay thank you I was blessed to be in in this room with you guys I really I'm excited I'm excited for you I really
0,Doc703,John doesn't judge people but I think he understands that the for somebody to preach and what he has to
0,Doc704,get to the end of this pitch and she's got her to Junior Executives on either side of her her just equal a disinterested
0,Doc705,so people want to know about her life and she uses her life as indirect father I think for her comedy it so people are pulling for more from Roseanne the person than Roseanne the character because they love her even though she is a powerful woman who has who has broken certain certain taboos in this business and in life and it still
0,Doc706,intend to do it but you know when you're writing something on the computer it's so easy to do all of a sudden and I I was writing a very important part of the book and there's a specific painting
0,Doc707,mad at people where the husband and wife have to say
0,Doc708,I think it depends on the writing of the show I think we have a special group because the way Liz doesn't is she treats it like it's a cable shows in that she doesn't have some formulas you just plugged in and we're trying to get to 100 to get to those syndication number every episode
0,Doc709,we're developing a relationship and then toward the end when they were
0,Doc710,open to do the same thing for my children that I want them to say hey what I say do you know please
0,Doc711,communicating better but communicating with passion and life that they didn't have before I feel me
0,Doc712,it's not going to choke them in and as far as the bib she said it's the most absorbent and so I actually got them try them and she's right I can't believe there's bibs on the market that things were all
0,Doc713,John you know so no I've never been particularly careerist and now more than ever I clearly a more focused on and nourished by the act of the working itself I like to act every day
0,Doc714,11 as a son you still don't want to face it so that's being okay and my father speaks very well
0,Doc715,I hope we meet in real life I want to meet you I would love to meet
0,Doc716,but it's easy just a cheese and do something that comes easy to me and actually but you know that's not why I'm in it
0,Doc717,you look at something might have done like bacon spacing too and you jump into the phone when you don't know how it's going to be a mother
0,Doc718,Driven Man I think he knew what he wanted he wanted to be a famous writer there was no question about it he wanted to change and he wanted saying and in writing I mean he wanted to write well he wanted to watch a true sentence
0,Doc719,when I look at ads the quote critics in the paper in the other weeping or they're they're falling out of their chair with laughter or you know my life will never be the same where's the greatest movie of all time I just shake my head because you know that's too excessive and so when I said I cried at I don't hardly ever cry at the movies and when I do cry it usually not because of something sad it's because of something of goodness somebody is good and in this young man Antwone Fisher is good and his life has been all messed up his father was killed too much before he was born he was born in prison his mother gave him up he went to a foster home where was mistreated and beaten and assault
0,Doc720,I could tell the very first day that we started filming they were just wrapping up the 60s until we we was sort of like just passed each other we loved each other a hug and surpass the Basilone ready they did and they just said it's been fantastic
0,Doc721,so when you try to make two people with two different rhythms come together it doesn't
0,Doc722,that have been searching for each other for lifetimes and this is the night when they
0,Doc723,if we were doing stand-up comedy you can have stuff acai
0,Doc724,France conscendo is consensus stuff is about politics the real question is what is about the science and that's why you know I said for example if you got a good model
0,Doc725,so I love the energy that it entails to make a song and to feed off another to create something
0,Doc726,so yeah that is a surprise that there was going to be anything but then I did some of the video games
0,Doc727,and I think one of the things that I've tried to do is to try to balance my career with you know in terms of television
0,Doc728,somebody to believe in them you know I gave them a job to do each day I had about 30-35 them I gave me a job to do and I had had them coming to work like 6:30 in the morning
0,Doc729,the crew local so I'm staying accident all the time so you know you hear it all the time and if you
0,Doc730,but don't you want to know that you know that I will sick that you know too that can test and you know I don't get it but I got to tell you that
0,Doc731,new 2D brought the reality of the time to a he brought the street sense of of the time
0,Doc732,a lot of people who know what it is to live with somebody who's in French
0,Doc733,and I believe it's true whoever said it I believe it was him basically as to when you begin to roll say I don't know how to do
